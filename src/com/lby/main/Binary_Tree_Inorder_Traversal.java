 * Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},

   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
return [1,3,2].

Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? > read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.
